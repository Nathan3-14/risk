# Rules of Advanced Risk
## Definitions
Force - A group of one or more [troops](#troops), (can be represented by a token)<br>
Resources - (iron, lumber) - Used to ***build***, represented by relevant tokens<br>
Build - Spend ***resources*** and money to place a [building](#building) in and ***occupied*** area<br>
Occupied - An area is occupied if there is a [troop](#troops) or a force on it<br>
Move - Move a [troop](#troops) or force to an adjacent area<br>
Transfer - Move any number of [troops](#troops) from one force to another, or an adjacent space<br>
Train - Move all [troops](#troops) in **training** to **ready** and buy [troops](#troops) into **training** according to their [costs](#costs)<br>
## Turn Order
1. Gain $5 + $2/factory
2. Per force on a resource, gain that resource
3. ***Train*** [troops](#troops)
4. ***Move*** and [Attack](#fighting)
5. [Build](#building)
6. ***Transfer*** from up to two forces
## Fighting
Only ***forces*** can attack. They can attack other ***forces***, [buildings](#building) and [troops](#troops).<br><br>
In order to attack, dice are rolled in accordance to the [atk values](#atk-and-def-forces) of the attacking troops.<br>
The dice can be grouped in order to try to beat the [def values](#atk-and-def-forces) of the defending [troops](#troops) or [buildings](#building).<br>
If there are any enemy forces remaining, they attack back with an additional 1D4/troop lost (max 3D4).<br>
If no attacking troop are lost, the most powerful attacking troop is lost.
If there are defending units left, all units return to their original positions.

### Atk and Def Forces
Troop | Atk Force | Def Force
-|-|-
Undefended Troop | N/A | 2
Infantry | D4 | 3
Cavalry | D4 + 1 | 5
Cannon | D4 (D6 + 1) | 3
Factory | D4 - 1 | 9
Capital | D6 + 3 | 15
Training Camp | D6 + 1 | 7
## Troops
Troops are individual units that can be part of forces.
### Costs
Troop | Cost
-|-
Infantry | $1
Cavalry | $3
Cannon | $6
## Building
Training Camp - Allows more troops to be trained - 2 iron, 4 lumber<br>
Factory - Produces passive income - 4 iron, 3 lumber
